# Who we are

We're a few developers passionate about building a future in Web3 that empowers entrepreneurs globally. We've decided to build an ecosystem of systems that can be used internally as well as globally.

The first finalized product of this ecosystem is the DEAN Marketplace. This is a Digital Marketplace Factory, a factory that generates new marketplaces for different niches using EVM chains, storing central information both on smart contracts, as well as a centralized database.

# Why use the marketplace?

Well, for starters, there's few ways that you can spend your staked tokens, or just unused coins found in your soft wallet. This system allows for any EVM compatible chain to deploy a commerce marketplace, so if you're bagholding or diamond handing, we're the platform that helps you buy real world goods, or trade real world goods to earn precious tokens.
